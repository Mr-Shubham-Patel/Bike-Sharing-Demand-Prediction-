# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 

# Project Summary
The bike sharing demand prediction project involved developing a machine learning model to accurately predict the demand for bike sharing based on various features such as temperature, hour of the day, humidity, functioning day, season, and others. The goal was to create a model that can help bike sharing companies optimize their operations, improve resource allocation, and enhance user experience.

The following steps were performed in the project:

Data Collection: Relevant data, including historical bike sharing demand data and related features, were collected from reliable sources such as public datasets, APIs, or company records.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Features were also transformed or encoded as needed to prepare them for machine learning modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed to gain insights into the data, understand the relationships between different features, and identify any patterns or trends that could impact bike sharing demand.

Feature Engineering: New features were created or existing features were transformed to extract relevant information and improve the predictive power of the model. This could include feature scaling, one-hot encoding, feature selection, or extraction of temporal features.

Model Selection: Different machine learning algorithms, such as Linear regression , decision tree , Random Forest, Gradient Boosting were evaluated and compared based on their performance metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, R2 score, and others.

Model Training: The selected model was trained on the preprocessed data using appropriate training techniques such as cross-validation or time-series split to prevent overfitting and ensure robustness.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as RMSE, R2 score, and others to assess its performance and generalization capability on unseen data.

The ultimate goal was to improve bike sharing operations and achieve a positive business impact.

# Problem Statement

With the introduction of rental bikes in many urban cities, the need to ensure the availability and accessibility of rental bikes to the public at the right time has become a critical concern. Efficient management of the rental bike fleet is essential to minimize waiting times for users and ensure a stable supply of bikes. The key problem statement is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the demand for rental bikes at each hour, allowing for effective planning and allocation of bikes to meet the demand.
